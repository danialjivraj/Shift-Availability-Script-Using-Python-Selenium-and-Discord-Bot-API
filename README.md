# Shift-Availability-Script-Using-Python-Selenium-and-Discord-Bot-API
The objective of this project was to create an infinite while loop script which checks for shifts of a specific website every x seconds by using Selenium. If there is available shifts, the Discord Bot pings the user and sends a notification of the available shift/s.
